# dt173g_project_admin
This is the Admin Portal for the project course in DT173G. 

The link at the bottom of this reamde will take you to the project folder. Each part of the project is hosted seperately and communicates via Fetch API. The project is hosted in three catalogues on my MIUN student website.

The admin portal presents a visual interface for CRUD functions. Created with PHP and styled with Bootstrap.
